    <h2>About wows-monitor</h2>
    <p>
      This app was created with <a [externalLink] href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a> and <a [externalLink]
        href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>.<br />
      It mainly functions as a user interface for data provided by a centralized API written in <a [externalLink]
        href="https://github.com/dotnet/core">.NET Core</a>.<br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This app uses publicly available data from the Waraming API as part of the WG DPP program.
      By using this app you agree to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>fetching data from API on your behalf</li>
      <li>processing of fetched data</li>
      <li>display of fetched data in this app</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It only accesses publicly available information (e.g. number of battles, statistics). We do not collect
      private data (e.g. email address, number of credits).
    </p>

      The color values for the Personal Rating and other stats are provided by <a [externalLink]
